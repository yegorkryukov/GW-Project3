# Exploring the Divide

Given the current political climate, and the flow of information through the power of words, we wanted to explore the language between left- and right-leaning media sites.

No judgment. No agenda. Just discovery.

We scraped 20 news media outlets (10 from each side of the isle) and analyzed the language using Machine Learning techniques. Visit [http://puddlenet.mindthatdata.com](http://puddlenet.mindthatdata.com) to see the results.
